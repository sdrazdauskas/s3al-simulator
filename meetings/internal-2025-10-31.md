# Meeting Summary

**Date:** — 2025-10-31
**Time:** — 11:00-11:30
**Attendees:** 4/5

## Solved Agenda
1. Adopt Unix-like `touch` semantics with per-file timestamps; show in `ls` (optionally `-l`).  
2. Add persistence: implement **save** (export FS to host disk) and **load** (rebuild FS on start or via command).  
3. Define path to script execution: `./script` runs a file of shell commands.
4. Begin kernel↔shell refactor: centralize command registration/dispatch outside Kernel.

## Key Discussion Points

### 1) File model & `touch`
- `touch` should create a file if missing; if it exists, **update its timestamp**.  
- Add a `timestamp` field to the file struct; display via `ls` (could show by default or with `-l`).

### 2) Shell features
- **Redirection** (`>`, `<`) is desirable but not required immediately.  
- Plan a **script runner**: `./file` reads lines and executes known commands sequentially.  

### 3) Persistence (save/load)
- Provide a **save** command to traverse from root and **materialize** directories/files on the host filesystem.  
- Provide a **load** command (or auto-load on start) to reconstruct the in-memory tree.  

### 4) Kernel ↔ Shell responsibilities
- Today, Kernel still prints some help and holds commands.  
- Target architecture: modules **register commands** with a registry; **Shell** parses and dispatches; Kernel focuses on syscalls/binding to modules.
