# Meeting Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Time:** 19:00–19:40 
**Attendees:** 5/5  

---

## Solved Agenda
1. Define implementation plan for **Process Manager** and **CPU Scheduler**.  
2. Finalize **Logger** integration through kernel callbacks.  
3. Agree on **presentation** and **demo** content for Thursday.  

---

## Key Discussion Points
1. **Process Manager design:**  
   - Still conceptual; will initially serve as a **fake call** without real data handling.  
   - Process Manager may return a simple confirmation so that the Kernel knows execution succeeded.  
   - Full failure handling postponed until after the demo due to time constraints.  

2. **Logger integration:**  
   - Each module will call a **callback function** for logging; the Kernel will connect these callbacks to the Logger module.  
   - Logger accepts three parameters: **level**, **module**, and **message**.  
   - Kernel will perform the wiring during initialization to simplify future module expansion.  

3. **Demo and module connections:**  
   - Kernel connects to **Storage Manager**, **Memory Manager**, and Logger.  
   - The demonstration will show basic file system commands (`ls`, `cd`, `touch`, `write`, `cat`, etc.) and logging outputs.  

4. **Collaboration and merging:**  
   - All merge requests should be submitted by Monday.  
   - Everyone will upload **personal time logs** and meeting summaries to a new **docs branch**.  

5. **VM for demo:**  
   - A dedicated **university VM** will be set up for evaluators.  
   - One team member will create the user account, define SSH credentials.
