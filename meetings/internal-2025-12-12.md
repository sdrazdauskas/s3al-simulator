# Meeting Summary

**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Time:** 11:00-12:00
**Attendees:** 4/5 

---

## Solved Agenda

1. Decide approach for **report diagrams**: reuse and update vs rebuild from scratch.  
2. Align on **report structure and content**: what belongs in the report vs README/appendices.  
3. Agree on **scope freeze** for implementation and define next steps (validation, documentation, testing).

---

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Diagrams strategy (update vs recreate)
- Most existing diagrams need **updates** due to recent code changes.
- Decision to rebuild or reuse depends on context:
  - **Basic diagrams** are acceptable for introductory or initial analysis sections.
- Target is a **small, high-quality set of diagrams** (approximately **4 core diagrams**, not an excessive number).
- Proposed additions:
  - **Use case diagram**
  - At least one **sequence / process-flow diagram** (process creation → scheduling → termination)

---

### 2. Implementation scope and remaining changes
- New features are considered **complete**.
- Remaining work limited to:
  - **Input validation**
  - **Robustness improvements** (reducing crashes, handling invalid input)
- Some report sections contain placeholders and must be **updated to reflect the current codebase**.

---

### 3. Demo and deployment discussion
- Deployment options discussed for evaluators:
  - Dedicated **VM**
  - **Binary download**
  - Repository-based instructions
- Concerns raised:
  - Repository access (public vs private)
  - How evaluators will run the system (SSH user, multiple terminals/processes)

---

### 4. Work distribution
- One team member assigned to **code validation fixes**.
- Remaining members focus on **report writing**.
- Responsibilities divided by topic:
  - Shell section and scripting
  - Diagram creation and updates
  - Related Work and references
