# Meeting Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Time:** 19:00–20:30  
**Attendees:** 5/5

## Solved Agenda
1. Debug inter-module communication between **Terminal**, **Shell**, and **Kernel**.  
2. Finalize structure for demo integration and ensure compilation on all systems.  
3. Clarify role of **Process Manager** and **CPU Scheduler** in prototype phase.

## Key Discussion Points
1. **Communication flow:**  
   The team reviewed how the **Terminal**, **Shell**, and **Kernel** interact. The **Terminal** captures user input, the **Shell** parses commands (e.g., `echo hello`), and the **Kernel** routes execution or returns results. A test flow using the `echo` command was chosen for the demo.  

2. **Kernel initialization:**  
   It was decided that the **Kernel** will act as the main entry point, responsible for initializing and linking all modules (Terminal, Shell, Process Manager, Storage). Other modules will avoid standalone `main()` functions to prevent linkage issues.  

3. **Code structure and namespaces:**  
   Developers agreed to use namespaces and modular class design for clarity. Each module will reside in a separate directory with its own header and implementation files. Cross-module dependencies will be minimized to avoid circular references.  

4. **CMake and build setup:**  
   The group discussed improving CMake configuration so all modules build together. One `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root directory managing dependencies and linking.  

5. **Demo preparation:**  
   The upcoming demo will show a basic functional loop:  
   - User enters a command in Terminal.  
   - Shell parses and sends the request to Kernel.  
   - Kernel processes and returns output to Terminal.  
   More advanced components (e.g., CPU scheduling, memory management) will be added in later iterations.  

6. **Current issues:**  
   - Multiple `main()` functions causing compile errors.  
   - Need for consistent include paths and initialization order.
