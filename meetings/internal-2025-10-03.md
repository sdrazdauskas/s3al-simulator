# Meeting Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Time:** 11:30–12:30  
**Attendees:** 5/5  

---

## Solved Agenda
1. Define initial modules and responsibilities for the operating system prototype.  
2. Establish workflow, structure, and meeting schedule for ongoing development.  

---

## Key Discussion Points
1. **Module planning:**  
   The team discussed which system modules to include in the first prototype — **Terminal**, **Shell**, **Kernel**, **Process Manager**, and **Storage Manager** — and agreed to postpone more complex ones like the **CPU Scheduler** and **Memory Manager** until later stages.  

2. **Role assignment:**  
   Each member was assigned a module to develop, with **Kernel** and **Shell** developers coordinating closely due to their interdependence.  

3. **GitLab workflow:**  
   Members agreed to create issues and milestones, using **merge requests** for all contributions.  
   Each module will have its own directory, and subtasks will be linked as child issues.  

4. **Technical clarifications:**  
   The team clarified that the **Terminal** handles user input/output while the **Shell** interprets commands and communicates with the **Kernel**.
