## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Report status
- The report is nearly complete.
- Remaining tasks include:
  - Adding the required references (target: ~15).
  - Finalizing and inserting diagrams.

### 2. Diagrams and documentation strategy
- Large, fully detailed class diagrams were considered costly to maintain.
- Preferred approach:
  - One high-level structural or component-style diagram for overview.
  - Simplified class diagrams that only support key concepts discussed in the report.

### 3. Demo environment and access
- A shared demo environment (VM) will be prepared.
- Multiple concurrent users should be supported, as previous container-based tests worked in parallel.
- Repository visibility was checked and fixed to ensure public access shows the full codebase.
